# 🔋 PINNs-XGBoost-Hybrid-for-RUL-estimation

A physics-informed deep learning framework for battery life prediction, leveraging a **hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and XGBoost model** to integrate electrochemical dynamics with data-driven patterns.

Achieves end-to-end **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** forecasting by learning battery-specific degradation parameters from the NASA Prognostics dataset.

## 🌟 Project Overview
This system provides high-fidelity predictions of battery capacity degradation by enforcing the **Arrhenius degradation law** within a neural network, creating a robust model that generalizes well. The hybrid approach uses the PINN as an intelligent feature extractor to enhance a powerful XGBoost model.

### **Key Capabilities**
- **Hybrid Model Prediction** – Combines a PINN with an XGBoost model to achieve **99.8% R² accuracy**
- **Physics-Informed Learning** – Embeds the Arrhenius degradation equation directly into the model's loss function to ensure physically plausible predictions.
- **Battery-Specific Embeddings** – Learns a unique "fingerprint" for each battery to capture individual manufacturing and chemical variations.
- **Dynamic Parameter Estimation** – A ParameterLearner network estimates physical constants (k, n, Ea) in real-time based on the battery's state.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation** – Validated using R², MAPE, and NRMSE metrics for a complete performance overview.

## 💾 Workflow Description

### **1. Data Processing**
**File:** `parseData.ipynb`
- Extracts dicharge cycle data from the raw NASA (`.mat`) files.
- Computes key features like average and normalized temperature and current.
- Splits data into training and testing sets, stratified by battery ID.

---

### **2. PINN Model Development**
**File:** `NN_Learner.ipynb`, `physics.py` and `Train.ipynb`
- A core ANN predicts the capacity (`C`) as a function of time (`t`), current (`I`) and Temperature (`T`), as these are the explicit features required for the Arrhenius Equation.
- The `BatteryEmbedding` layer creates a 6-d-dimensional vector for each unique battery
- A `ParameterLearner` network uses the predicted capacity and battery embedding to estimate physical degradation parameters (Ea, k, and n).
- The model is trained using a combination of Adam and L-BFGS optimizers for stability and precision.

---

### **3. Hybrid XGBoost Model**
**File:** `Hybrid.ipynb`
- Loads the trained PINN model weights
- Uses the PINN to create battery embeddinng and the physical parameters for the dataset.
- Combines the original features with these new physics-informed features.
- Trains an XGBRegressor on this newly formed dataset to make final, highly accurate capacity predictions, followed by saving the model.

### **4. RUL Estimation**
**File:** `RUL.ipynb`
- Loads the trained PINN model and XGBoost weights.
- Iterates through the number of cycles the capacity remains above a certain threshold capacity
- Compares the predictied and the ground truth RUL values, followed by plotting the forecast.

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

**PINN Composite Loss Function**
The model is trained by minimizing a combination of data error and the physics residual.
$L_{total} = \lambda_{data} \cdot L_{data} + \lambda_{physics} \cdot L_{physics}$

**Arrhenius Degradation Equation**
The physics loss ($L_{physics}$) is the residual of this differential equation, where $\frac{dC}{dt}$ is computed via automatic differentiation.
$\frac{dC}{dt} = -k \cdot I^n \cdot e^{-E_a / (RT)}$

**RUL Calculation**

The function predicts a battery’s **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** by forecasting its capacity \( C \) across cycles until it drops below the **End of Life (EOL)** threshold.

---

### 1. Initialization
At start cycle \( c_s \):
\[
C_{\text{start}} = C(c_s)
\]
and PINN models generate physics-based features:
\[
(k, n, E_a), \; \text{embeddings} = f_{\text{PINN}}(x_{\text{start}})
\]

---

### 2. Normalization
For each future cycle \( c_f \):
\[
t_{\text{norm}} = \frac{c_f - c_{\min}}{c_{\max} - c_{\min}}
\]
Form hybrid input:
\[
X = [t_{\text{norm}}, T_{\text{norm}}, I_{\text{norm}}, \text{embeddings}, k, n, E_a]
\]

---

### 3. Capacity Forecast
Predict next capacity using XGBoost:
\[
C_{\text{new}} = f_{\text{XGB}}(X)
\]
Repeat until:
\[
C_{\text{new}} \leq C_{\text{EOL}}
\]

---

### 4. Remaining Useful Life
\[
\text{RUL} = c_f - c_s
\]
